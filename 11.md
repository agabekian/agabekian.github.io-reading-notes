nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	NoSQL
 	 
 	 SQL called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); 
     whereas NoSQL  called as non-relational or distributed database.

SQL databases are table based databases
NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 
This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

SQL - predefined schema whereas 
NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

SQL databases are vertically scalable
 NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. 
 
 SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. 


4NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database
 	 
 	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

_complex query intensive environment hierarchical data storage_

Give a real world example.
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

Give a real world example.

Hbase is an example for this purpose.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

SQL

Which type of database is best for scalability?

>In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

What does SQL stand for?

_structured query language _

What is a relational database?

_A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another._

What type of structure does a relational database work with?

_logical data structures_

What is a ‘schema’?

_"blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models._

What is a NoSQL database?

>A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

How does it work?

What is inside of a Mongo database?

BSON documents, gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDb
Flexibility: NoSQL databases generally provide flexible schemas that enable faster and more iterative development. The flexible data model makes NoSQL databases ideal for semi-structured and unstructured data

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

Data size in MongoDB is typically higher due to e.g. each document has field names stored it

less flexibity with querying (e.g. no JOINs)

no support for transactions - certain atomic operations are supported, at a single document level

at the moment Map/Reduce (e.g. to do aggregations/data analysis) is OK, but not blisteringly fast. So if that's required, something like Hadoop may need to be added into the mix

less up to date information available/fast evolving product
