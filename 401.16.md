#### Authentication and Access Control
Application security boils down to two more or less independent problems: authentication (who are you?) and authorization (what are you allowed to do?). Sometimes people say “access control” instead of "authorization", which can get confusing, but it can be helpful to think of it that way because “authorization” is overloaded in other places. Spring Security has an architecture that is designed to separate authentication from authorization and has strategies and extension points for both.

AuthenticationManagerBuilder - great for setting up in-memory, JDBC, or LDAP user details or for adding a custom UserDetailsService
AuthenticationManagerBuilder is @Autowired into a method in a @Bean — that is what makes it build the global (parent) AuthenticationManager.
Once authentication is successful, we can move on to authorization, and the core strategy here is AccessDecisionManager. There are three implementations provided by the framework and all three delegate to a chain of AccessDecisionVoter instances, a bit like the ProviderManager delegates to AuthenticationProviders.
