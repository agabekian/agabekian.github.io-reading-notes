What is functional programming?
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

> It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
> It does not cause any observable side effects


What are the benefits of a pure function?

_easier to test_

What is immutability?

> When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

What is Referential transparency?

> Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

>pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

What is a module?
>A module in JavaScript is just a file containing related code. In JavaScript, we use the import and export keywords to share and receive functionalities respectively across different modules. The export keyword is used to make a variable, function, class or object accessible to other modules.

What does the word ‘require’ do?

_The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules_

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

_We import the module_

What do we have to do to make a module available?

_We export da module_
    module.exports = Whatever;
