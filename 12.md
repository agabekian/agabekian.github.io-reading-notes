In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

100’s = information status codes
>Usually tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client. Like using a different protocol or telling the client that its request will fail before they start sending the body.


200’s = success codes,  request was accepted.
300’s = redirection codes
>Resource requested isn’t available at the expected location anymore. This can have multiple reasons, be temporary or permanent, but the client has to issue a request to the new location.


400’s = client error codes.
>They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server. There are several causes to this, timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication, etc. A client is sending incorrect input and should confirm the input parameters are correct before retrying the request.


500’s = server error codes, _retrying is advised_
What is a status code 202?

>In case of asynchronous processing of a request (202), this doesn’t mean the request was successfully processed only that it met all validation requirements at the time of sending.


What is a status code 308?
>Permanent Redirect - This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It’s helpful when we have multiple endpoints for one resource, but don’t want to implement reading from all of them.

What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

>204 No Content - A proper code for updates that don’t return data to the client, for example when just saving a currently edited document.

What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

404
