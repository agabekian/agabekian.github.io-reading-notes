JPA

JpaRepository provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch

And so, because of this inheritance relationship, the JpaRepository contains the full API of CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository.


    public interface JpaRepository<T, ID extends Serializable> extends
    PagingAndSortingRepository<T, ID> {

        List<T> findAll();

        List<T> findAll(Sort sort);

        List<T> save(Iterable<? extends T> entities);

        void flush();

        T saveAndFlush(T entity);

        void deleteInBatch(Iterable<T> entities);
    }


findAll() – get a List of all available entities in database
findAll(…) – get a List of all available entities and sort them using the provided condition
save(…) – save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to save them in a batch
flush() – flush all pending task to the database
saveAndFlush(…) – save the entity and flush changes immediately
deleteInBatch(…) – delete an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to delete them in a batch
Clearly, above interface extends PagingAndSortingRepository which means it has all methods present in the CrudRepository as well.
