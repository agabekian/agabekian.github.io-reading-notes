#### What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?

Class is a blueprint from which objects are created which is their primary purpose. You instantiate the objects through class. Even if we create object on the fly without us explicitly creating a class, class, which is a "primitive structure" is still used by Java

Key Differences between Class and Object
A class is a template for creating objects in a program, whereas the object is an instance of a class.
A class is a logical entity, while an object is a physical entity.
A class does not allocate memory space; on the other hand, an object allocates memory space.
You can declare a class only once, but you can create more than one object using a class.
Classes can’t be manipulated, while objects can be manipulated.
Classes don’t have any values, whereas objects have their own values.
You can create a class using “class” keyword, while hand you can create an object using “new” keyword in Java.

#### What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.

Design pattern is a general "description of template" how to solve a scpecific software problem that can be reused in other situations. A concept. Also defined as "formalized best practices" that we can use to solve common problems while developing.  My attempt at the analogy would perhaps be how I go about creating a sound/song project - the are certain proven steps in organizing project files and logical blocks of the material that help reduce the headache down the road and help to reuse the material later .

#### Static methods are also called what? Why?

They are also called "class methods" because a static method belongs to and is part of the class itself rather than being a method of instantiated object of a class.
