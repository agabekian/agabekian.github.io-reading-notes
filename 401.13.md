In this article, we implemented a few simple Spring-enabled integration tests.

We also looked at the WebApplicationContext and MockMvc object creation, which plays an important role in calling the endpoints of the application.

Looking further, we discussed how to send GET and POST requests with variations of parameter passing, and how to verify the HTTP response status, header, and content.

Then we evaluated some limitations of MockMvc. Knowing these limitations can guide us to make an informed decision about how we're going to implement our tests.

Finally, the implementation of all these examples and code snippets is available over on GitHub.
