Amplify - direct feature integration with AWSâ€™ powerful backend services.
Now the main strength of Amplify is that it quickly lets you add thigs like Storage, Authentication, Monitoring, and PubSub functionalities.
I tend to think Amplify is an attractive tool because it allows developers to add application functionality without having to know what AWS services to use to achieve that functionality


ORM and DAO are orthogonal concepts. One has to do with how objects are mapped to database tables, the other is a design pattern for writing objects that access data. You don't choose 'between' them. You can have ORM and DAO is the same application, just as you don't need ORM to use the DAO pattern.

That said, while you never really need anything, you should use DAOs. The pattern lends itself to modularized code. You keep all your persistence logic in one place (separation of concerns, fight leaky abstractions). You allow yourself to test data access separately from the rest of the application. And you allow yourself to test the rest of the application isolated from data access (i.e. you can mock your DAOs).

Plus, following the DAO pattern is easy, even if implementing data access can be difficult. So it costs you very little (or nothing) and you gain a lot...
