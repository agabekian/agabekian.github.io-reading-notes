### Many  to Many
_Employee_ can be assigned to multiple projects and a _project_ may have multiple employees working for it, leading to a many-to-many association between the two.

We have an employee table with employee_id as its primary key and a project table with project_id as its primary key. A join table employee_project is required here to connect both sides.


Employee class and Project classes refer to one another, which means that the association between them is bidirectional.

In order to map a many-to-many association, we use the @ManyToMany, @JoinTable and @JoinColumn annotations. Let's have a closer look at them.

The @ManyToMany annotation is used in both classes to create the many-to-many relationship between the entities.

This association has two sides i.e. the owning side and the inverse side. In our example, the owning side is Employee so the join table is specified on the owning side by using the @JoinTable annotation in Employee class. The @JoinTable is used to define the join/link table. In this case, it is Employee_Project.

The @JoinColumn annotation is used to specify the join/linking column with the main table. Here, the join column is employee_id and project_id is the inverse join column since Project is on the inverse side of the relationship.

In the Project class, the mappedBy attribute is used in the @ManyToMany annotation to indicate that the employees collection is mapped by the projects collection of the owner side.
