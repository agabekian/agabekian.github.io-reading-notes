How does pair programming work?

>Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on th>keyboard.  Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, versio>control, and—of course  writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide an>direct input to the computer. The  Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm migh>be converted in to code, while scanning for  typos or bugs.
