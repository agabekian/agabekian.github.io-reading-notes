## Putting it all together
[__React Docs - Thinking in React__](/https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

1.What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
 
Component should ideally only do one thing and be modulrized as it grows.

2.What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

Tobuild the app without interactivity (ie without state)

3.Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

Needed interactivity (with well chosen places for state)


4.What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

> 1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
> 1. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
> 1. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

5.How can you identify where state needs to live?

>Identify every component that renders something based on that state. <br>
>Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).<br>
>Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.<br>
>If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.<br>

[__Higher-Order Functions__](/https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

1.What is a “higher-order function”?

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

2.Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

It returns an another function that return _m_ if greater than _n_.

3.Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

  MAP: transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values.
  REDUCE: builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value.
