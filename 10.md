What is a ‘call’?

_function invocation_

How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

_one at a time_

> Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

What does LIFO mean?

>LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

What causes a Stack Overflow?

> A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

What is a ‘reference error’?

>his is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

    console.log(foo) // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
This is also a common thing when using const and let, they are hoisted like var and function but there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs, the fact that this happens to let and const is called Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

    foo = 'Hello' // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
    let foo
Whatever you are using (var, let or const) the fix is as simple has declaring the variable before any declaration is made.

    let foo;
    foo = 'Hello'

What is a ‘syntax error’?

> this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

What is a ‘range error’?

> Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

What is a ‘type error’?

> this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

What is a breakpoint?

> make your program stop at the specified point 

What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

> A debugger is a software tool that can help the software development process by identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development. Some debuggers will analyze a test run to see what lines of code were not executed.
