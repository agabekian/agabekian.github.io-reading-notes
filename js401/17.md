## Advanced State with Reducers

Adding a reducer in React can be motivated by several factors:

1. **Complex State Logic**: As your application grows, the state management logic might become more complex. Reducers help manage this complexity by centralizing state transitions and making them easier to understand.

2. **Predictable State Changes**: Reducers enforce a **strict pattern** for state updates, making it easier to predict how the state will change in response to different actions.

3. **Testing**: Reducers are typically **pure functions**, which makes them easier to test in isolation. You can test different state transitions by providing different actions to the reducer.

4. **Debugging**: Woo! Reducers can provide a clear trace of how the state changes over time.

### Reducer actions 

are plain JavaScript objects that describe the type of state transition that should occur. These actions typically have a `type` property that specifies the type of action, along with any additional data required for the state transition.

The key difference between setting state directly and using actions in a reducer is that reducers provide a _**structured and centralized way to manage state transitions**_ . 

By dispatching actions to the reducer, you decouple the state transitions from the components that trigger them, which can lead to better separation of concerns and easier maintenance of your codebase.

`useReduce` is named for the common list operation "reduce", which is used to transform a list into a single value by applying a function to each element and accumulating the results. Similarly, `useReducer` in React is used to manage state transitions by applying a reducer function to the current state and an action, resulting in a new state.

Switching from `useState` to `useReducer` when:

1. **State Logic Becomes Complex**: If your component's state logic becomes too complex to manage with `useState`, `useReducer` might be a better choice. It provides a more structured approach to state management, especially when dealing with multiple related state variables or complex state transitions.

2. **Need for Centralized State Management**: If you find yourself passing state updater functions down _multiple levels_ of component hierarchy, or if you're dealing with shared state that needs to be accessed by multiple components, `useReducer` can provide a more centralized approach to state management.

3. **Performance Considerations**: In some cases, `useReducer` _**might**_ offer better performance compared to `useState`, especially when dealing with deeply nested state updates or when the next state depends on the previous state.
