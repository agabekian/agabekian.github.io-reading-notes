#### Event Driven Programming

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

The native Node.js module for Event Driven Programming is called events.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?  

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) complements Event Driven Programming by organizing code into reusable components, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

3.Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Event Driven Programming in Node.js allows servers to respond efficiently to various events, like client requests or data reading, improving scalability and handling multiple tasks simultaneously.

Imagine you're playing a game where you have to react to different events happening around you. For example, when an enemy appears, you need to attack; when you collect a power-up, you gain abilities. Similarly, on the backend using Node.js, Event Driven Programming allows the server to respond to various events such as receiving a request from a client, reading data from a file, or receiving a message from another server. This allows for efficient handling of asynchronous tasks and enables the server to scale and handle multiple operations simultaneously without blocking.


_Additional Questions:_  
Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, I look forward to learning more about advanced topics in Node.js such as streams, child processes, and clustering.

Learning goals include gaining a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming in Node.js, mastering event-driven architecture, and becoming proficient in building scalable and efficient server-side applications using Node.js.
