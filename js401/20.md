1	State Management Challenges: The article identifies the complexities of managing state in sizable React projects, especially when dealing with deeply nested components and the necessity of passing props down the component tree.
	2	Context API and useContext Hook: It introduces the Context API as a solution to create global state accessible to any component without the need for prop drilling. It also explains how the useContext hook facilitates the consumption of context within functional components.
	3	Reducer Function: The article delves into the useReducer hook, which provides an alternative to useState for handling more intricate state logic. It emphasizes the role of the reducer function in computing the new state based on the current state and an action.
	4	Combining Context and Reducer: It illustrates the integration of Context and useReducer to establish a global state container accessible across the application. Through examples, it demonstrates how to create a context with a reducer and utilize it for state management.
	5	Benefits of the Approach: The article outlines the advantages of this approach, including enhanced code organization, improved separation of concerns, and simplified state management in larger projects.
