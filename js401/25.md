#### Redux - Combined Reducers

Creating multiple reducers in Redux is a common practice to manage different parts of the application state independently. This helps in organizing code, separating concerns, and making it easier to reason about the application's state management. Each reducer typically handles a specific slice of the overall state.

To combine multiple reducers in Redux, you use the `combineReducers` utility function provided by Redux. This function takes an object as an argument, where each key represents a slice of the state, and each value is a reducer function responsible for managing that slice of state. The `combineReducers` function then returns a single reducer function that combines the output of all individual reducers into a single state object.

Managing state as an immutable object is important in Redux because it helps maintain the predictability and traceability of state changes. By enforcing immutability, Redux ensures that state changes are explicit and traceable, which makes it easier to debug and reason about the application's behavior, especially in large and complex applications.

`combineReducers` is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers, which is managing multiple slices of state. It assembles the new state tree by calling each individual reducer with the corresponding slice of the state, and then combining the results into a single state object.

When defining initial state in an app using `combineReducers`, you would define an initial state object where each key corresponds to a slice of the state managed by a specific reducer. Each reducer defines its own initial state, and `combineReducers` combines these initial states into a single initial state object.

As an app becomes more complex, splitting reducing functions becomes beneficial because it helps in managing complexity, improving maintainability, and enabling code reuse. By breaking down reducers into smaller, focused functions, it becomes easier to understand, test, and modify specific parts of the state management logic.

The `combineReducers` helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to `createStore`.

A popular convention when naming reducers is to use descriptive names that indicate the slice of state they manage. For example, if a reducer manages the user authentication state, it might be named `authReducer`. This convention helps developers quickly identify the purpose of each reducer in the application.
