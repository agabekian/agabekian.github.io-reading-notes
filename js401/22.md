### API Server Build
Difference between a Query String Parameter and a Path Parameter:

_Path Parameter:_

Part of the URL path itself.

Typically used to identify a specific resource.

Example: In the URL http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things, things is a path parameter.

Syntax: /resource/{parameter}.

Query String Parameter:

Appended to the URL after a question mark (?).

Often used to filter or sort resources.

Example: In the URL http://our-site.com/v3/stuff?category=things, category=things is a query string parameter.

Syntax: ?key=value.

API URL with a Path ID Parameter:

Given the information:

Domain: http://our-site.com
Version: v3
Model name: stuff
ID parameter: things
The API URL with a path ID parameter would be:

bash
Copy code
http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things
Dynamic API Interface Description:

Imagine you have a remote control for your TV. Each button on the remote performs a specific function, like changing the channel, adjusting the volume, or turning the TV on and off. An API interface works in a similar way. Instead of physical buttons, it has endpoints (like URLs) that you can "press" by sending requests. These endpoints allow you to interact with a server to get information, update data, or perform actions. It's a set of rules and tools that lets different software applications communicate with each other, much like how your remote communicates with your TV.

Auth Server Build
Using Middleware for Basic and Bearer Auth:

#### Basic Auth Middleware:

Basic Auth involves sending a username and password with each request.
Middleware intercepts each request, decodes the base64 encoded credentials from the Authorization header, and verifies them.
If the credentials are valid, the request proceeds to the next middleware or route handler.

#### Example in Express.js:
    function basicAuth(req, res, next) {
    const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (!authHeader) return res.sendStatus(401);
    const base64Credentials = authHeader.split(' ')[1];
    const credentials = Buffer.from(base64Credentials, 'base64').toString('ascii');
    const [username, password] = credentials.split(':');
    if (username === 'admin' && password === 'secret') {
    next();
    } else 
        res.sendStatus(401);
    }
#### Bearer Auth Middleware:

Bearer Auth uses a token that is sent with each request.
Middleware extracts the token from the Authorization header, verifies it (e.g., with a JWT library), and attaches the user information to the request object.
Example in Express.js:

    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    function bearerAuth(req, res, next) {
    const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (!authHeader) 
        return res.sendStatus(401);
    const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1];
    jwt.verify(token, 'secretKey', (err, user) => {
    if (err) 
        return res.sendStatus(403);
    req.user = user;
    next();
    });
    }


#### OAuth Handshake:

Request Authorization: The client requests authorization from the resource owner.
Grant Authorization: The resource owner grants authorization.
Authorization Code: The client receives an authorization code from the authorization server.
Access Token Request: The client requests an access token from the authorization server using the authorization code.
Access Token Response: The authorization server returns an access token.
Resource Access: The client uses the access token to access the resource server.
#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Imagine you have a big house with many rooms. Each room has a specific function, like a kitchen, a bedroom, and an office. You don't want everyone to have access to every room. For instance, only the cook should enter the kitchen, only family members should enter the bedroom, and only you should enter your private office.

RBAC works similarly. In a company or application:

Roles are like job titles (e.g., admin, user, guest).
Permissions are like keys that unlock access to specific rooms or actions (e.g., read, write, delete).
Users are assigned roles, and roles are given permissions.
This ensures that people can only access what they're supposed to, based on their role, keeping everything secure and organized.
