What is an EC2 Instance?

    An EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the AWS infrastructure.

Name 2 use cases for EC2:

    Web hosting: Running websites or web applications on virtual servers.
    
    Batch processing: Processing large volumes of data or performing  intensive tasks.
Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com:

    ECS (Elastic Container Service) provides more flexibility and control over the infrastructure compared to platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions like Heroku, Digital Ocean App Platform, or Render.com. With ECS, you can manage containers directly, choose instance types, and fine-tune configurations according to your specific needs.

Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?

    You can find EC2 under the "Compute" section in the AWS Management Console.
    
Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL:

    T2 Micro and XL are both types of EC2 instances, but they differ in their specifications, primarily in terms of CPU, memory, storage, and network performance. T2 Micro is a small instance suitable for low-traffic applications or development environments, while XL instances offer more resources and are typically used for high-traffic or resource-intensive workloads.

Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend:

    Think of a compute cycle as a unit of work done by a computer. When you ask a computer to do something, like load a webpage or run a program, it goes through a series of steps to complete that task. Each step it takes is a compute cycle. The more complex the task, the more compute cycles it needs.

What is Elastic Beanstalk?

    Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering from AWS that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. It automatically handles the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling of your application, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk:

    Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 instances to deploy and run applications. It abstracts the complexity of provisioning and managing EC2 instances by providing a managed platform where developers can deploy their applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure directly. Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of the EC2 instances on behalf of the user.
Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk:

    Simplified deployment: Elastic Beanstalk automates the deployment process, making it easier and faster to deploy.
    
    Scalability: Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales the infrastructure based on the demand, ensuring optimal performance without manual intervention.  
    
    Monitoring and management: Elastic Beanstalk provides built-in monitoring and management tools to monitor the health and performance of applications.  
    
    Cost-effectiveness: By automating infrastructure management, Elastic Beanstalk can help reduce operational costs associated with deploying and managing applications.
