### Five Principles for Structuring State

1. **Identify Where State Should Live**: Determine which components need to access the state and place the state in the nearest common ancestor component.
2. **Keep State to a Minimum**: Only store essential state and derive other necessary information from this minimal state.
3. **Avoid Redundant State**: Ensure state is only stored in one place and avoid duplicating state to prevent inconsistencies.
4. **Lift State Up**: When multiple components need access to the same state, lift the state up to their nearest common ancestor.
5. **Use Reducers for Complex State Logic**: When state logic becomes complex or requires multiple actions, consider using a reducer to manage state updates more predictably.

### Passing State Deeply with Context

**Problem Contexts Aim to Solve**:
Contexts are designed to solve the problem of "prop drilling," which occurs when state or functions need to be passed through many levels of components, resulting in complex and hard-to-maintain code. Context allows for sharing state across the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

**Technique to Try Before useContext**:
Before using `useContext`, you can try **lifting state up**. This involves moving the shared state to the nearest common ancestor of the components that need to access it. By doing so, you can pass the state and any necessary functions as props directly to the components that need them, avoiding the need for context in simpler cases.

**Hook that Complements useContext for Complex Applications**:
The hook that complements `useContext` for complex applications is `useReducer`. `useReducer` is useful for managing more complex state logic and actions, providing a more predictable way to handle state updates compared to using plain state with `useState`. When combined with `useContext`, `useReducer` can help manage and share state effectively across different parts of an application.
