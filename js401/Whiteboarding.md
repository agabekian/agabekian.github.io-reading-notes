### Whiteboard: Explain Problem Domain and Other Parts

When preparing for technical interviews, particularly those involving coding problems or system design, understanding the **problem domain** and effectively using the **whiteboard** are crucial. Here's a breakdown of these concepts and how they relate to whiteboarding:

#### Problem Domain
The **problem domain** refers to the specific area of knowledge or activity within which a problem exists. Understanding the problem domain involves:

1. **Defining the Scope**: Clearly identify the boundaries of the problem. Understand what is included and what is excluded.
2. **Understanding Requirements**: Know the requirements and constraints of the problem. This includes inputs, outputs, expected behavior, performance constraints, etc.
3. **Contextual Knowledge**: Have a good grasp of the underlying concepts, rules, and relationships within the domain. For instance, if solving a problem related to e-commerce, understand concepts like shopping carts, payments, and user authentication.

#### Parts of Whiteboard Problem Solving
When solving problems on a whiteboard, especially in an interview setting, follow these structured steps:

1. **Problem Clarification**:
    - Ask questions to clarify any ambiguities.
    - Restate the problem in your own words to ensure understanding.

2. **Outline the Approach**:
    - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
    - Discuss your plan before diving into coding. This might include pseudocode, algorithms, or data structure choices.

3. **Design and Diagram**:
    - **Draw Diagrams**: Use diagrams to visualize the problem. This can include flowcharts, system architecture diagrams, or data structure layouts.
    - **Identify Components**: Clearly label different components and their interactions.

4. **Write Code**:
    - Write clean, modular code. Start with a high-level structure, then fill in the details.
    - Explain your code as you write it. This helps the interviewer follow your thought process.

5. **Test and Debug**:
    - Walk through your code with sample inputs to verify its correctness.
    - Discuss potential edge cases and how your code handles them.

6. **Optimize and Improve**:
    - Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
    - Discuss any optimizations or alternative approaches if time permits.

### Example of Whiteboard Problem Solving
Let's walk through an example problem using the steps outlined:

#### Problem: Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

1. **Problem Clarification**:
    - Clarify if the string is ASCII or Unicode.
    - Ask if the solution should be case-sensitive.

2. **Outline the Approach**:
    - Discuss using a sliding window approach with two pointers.
    - Explain how to use a set to track characters in the current window.

3. **Design and Diagram**:
    - Draw a simple diagram showing the sliding window mechanism on a sample string.

4. **Write Code**:
   ```python
   def longest_substring_without_repeating(s: str) -> int:
       char_set = set()
       left = 0
       max_length = 0

       for right in range(len(s)):
           while s[right] in char_set:
               char_set.remove(s[left])
               left += 1
           char_set.add(s[right])
           max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

       return max_length
   ```

5. **Test and Debug**:
    - Test with the string "abcabcbb". Walk through the function to show how it computes the result.
    - Discuss edge cases like an empty string or a string with all identical characters.

6. **Optimize and Improve**:
    - Analyze the time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string.
    - Discuss how this approach is optimal for this problem.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively communicate your problem-solving skills and technical knowledge during a whiteboard interview.
