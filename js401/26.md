#### Redux - Asynchronous Actions
    Why use Redux middleware?
    Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.
    How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?
    Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?
    Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.
    Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.

Redux middleware, such as _Redux Thunk_, is crucial for handling asynch actions in Redux applications. Without middleware, Redux is designed to handle synchronous actions, meaning it can't directly handle operations like data fetching or asynchronous API calls.

In the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram, when an action creator dispatches an asynchronous action, such as fetching data from an API, Redux Thunk intercepts this action before it reaches the reducers. Thunk middleware allows action creators to return functions instead of plain action objects. These functions (thunks) receive the `dispatch` and `getState` functions as arguments, giving them the ability to dispatch multiple actions, perform async operations, and access the current state of the Redux store if necessary.

When an action creator returns a function (a thunk), Redux Thunk middleware invokes this function with `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments. Inside the thunk function, you can perform any asynchronous operation, such as fetching data from an API. Once the asynchronous operation is complete, the thunk can dispatch additional actions to update the Redux store with the fetched data or handle any errors.

The return value from the inner thunk function is **not** directly accessible outside the thunk itself. 
Instead, if the inner thunk returns a **promise** (common when performing async operations), Redux Thunk middleware doesn't interfere with it. It's up to the thunk to resolve or reject the promise as needed. Any data returned by resolving the promise can be processed within the thunk and dispatched as subsequent actions to update the Redux store.
