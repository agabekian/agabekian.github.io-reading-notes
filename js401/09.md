### WebSocket:
•	Definition: Protocol for full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection.
•	Handshake: Client sends a handshake request, server responds, establishing the connection.
•	After Connection: Bidirectional, real-time messaging between client and server.
#### Socket.IO:
•	Event Handling: io.on() listens for events from clients.
•	Message Sending: socket.emit() sends messages between client and server.
#### Proof of Life / Code Verification:
•	Use logging, network monitoring, and error handling.
#### Socket.IO vs. WebSocket:
•	WebSocket: Protocol; Socket.IO: Library with additional features.
•	Use Socket.IO for real-time apps with broad browser support; WebSocket for low-level, high-performance apps.
#### When to Use:
•	Socket.IO: Real-time apps, cross-browser compatibility.
