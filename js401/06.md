1. **What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?**
    - JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties, commonly used for authentication and authorization.

2. **When should we use JSON Web Tokens?**
    - JWTs are useful in distributed systems where secure transmission of information between client and server is needed without relying on a centralized authentication server.

3. **Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?**
    - Claims are expected in the payload component of a JWT.

4. **Are JWTs Secure?**
    - JWTs are secure when implemented correctly, relying on digital signatures for integrity and confidentiality. However, they can be vulnerable to attacks if used improperly.

5. **If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?**
    - While decoding the payload doesn't compromise security, the integrity and confidentiality of the JWT rely on the signature, which should only be verifiable by the intended recipient who possesses the secret key.

6. **If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.**
    - Both the sender and receiver must know the secret key used to sign the token, which is appended in the signature.

7. **Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.**
    - You can use an analogy of a lockbox where the secret message is placed. The sender shares the lockbox key (secret key) with the recipient, ensuring only authorized parties can access the contents. Similarly, in JWT, the secret key ensures that only authorized parties can read the token's contents.

8. **What are the three components (the structure) of a JWT signature?**
    - The three components of a JWT are the header, payload, and signature.
