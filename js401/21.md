### RBAC
 is a method for managing user permissions in a system based on the roles assigned to individual users. 
Each role is associated with a set of permissions that define what operations a user in that role can perform. 
 
This approach simplifies the management of permissions by grouping them into roles _**rather than assigning them individually**_ to users.

Example of RBAC with CRUD Operations
Consider an e-commerce application with the following roles and associated CRUD operations:
1.	Admin
2.	Seller
3.	Customer
4.	Guest
###### Resources
    Products
    Orders
    User Accounts
#### Role Permissions
###### Admin:

    Products: Create, Read, Update, Delete
    Orders: Create, Read, Update, Delete
    User Accounts: Create, Read, Update, Delete

###### Seller:

    Products: Create, Read, Update, Delete
    Orders: Read, Update
    User Accounts: Read

###### Customer:

    Products: Read
    Orders: Create, Read, Update
    User Accounts: Read, Update

###### Guest:
    Products: Read
    Orders: None
    User Accounts: None
##### Example CRUD Operations by Role
1.	Admin
◦	Create a new product.
◦	Read all products and orders.
◦	Update existing user accounts.
◦	Delete any order.
2.	Seller
◦	Create a new product.
◦	Read and update existing products and orders.
◦	View user accounts but cannot create, update, or delete them.
3.	Customer
◦	Read products.
◦	Create, read, and update orders.
◦	View and update own user account.
4.	Guest
◦	Read products.
◦	Cannot create, read, update, or delete orders.
◦	Cannot access user accounts at all.
#### Benefits of RBAC
1.	Simplified Management: Permissions are assigned to roles rather than individual users, making it easier to manage and update access controls.
   2.	Enhanced Security: Reduces the risk of granting excessive permissions to users, thereby minimizing potential security breaches.
   3.	Operational Efficiency: New users can be quickly onboarded by assigning them appropriate roles without having to configure permissions individually.
   4.	Compliance:
   ◦	Easier to comply with regulatory requirements by providing a clear structure of access control that can be audited.
   5.	Flexibility and Scalability:
   ◦	Roles can be easily modified to adapt to changes in organizational structure or responsibilities, and new roles can be created as needed.
   6.	Separation of Duties:
   ◦	Helps implement the principle of least privilege and separation of duties, reducing the risk of fraud and errors.
### Comparing react-cookie and react-cookies
   #### react-cookie Library
   The react-cookie library is designed to provide utilities for handling cookies in a React application. It offers features that make it easy to manage cookies for client-side applications.
   Features of react-cookie:
   - Hook-based API: Provides hooks like useCookies for functional components.
   - SSR Support: Supports server-side rendering (SSR) with frameworks like Next.js.
   - Cookie Management: Easily set, get, and remove cookies.
   - Cookie Attributes: Supports setting various cookie attributes such as path, domain, maxAge, expires, secure, and httpOnly.
   #### react-cookies Component
   The react-cookies component is another library for managing cookies in React applications but with a different approach.
   Features of react-cookies:
   - Component-based API: Provides components like CookiesProvider for managing cookies in React components.
   - SSR Support: Also supports server-side rendering.
   - Cookie Management: Similar to react-cookie, allows setting, getting, and removing cookies.
   - Lifecycle Methods: Provides lifecycle methods to manage cookies during the component lifecycle.
   Preference and Justification
   Preferred Library: react-cookie
   Reason:
   - Modern API: The hook-based API (useCookies) of react-cookie is more aligned with modern React practices, especially for functional components, which are now the preferred way to write React components.
   - Simplicity: Hooks simplify the state management and side effects related to cookies, making the code more readable and maintainable.
   - Flexibility: The ability to use hooks makes it easier to integrate with other modern React features and patterns, providing a more seamless development experience.
   
While both libraries offer similar core functionality and support SSR, the modern approach and simplicity of the react-cookie library make it a more suitable choice for contemporary React development.
