# Engineering Readings 


> 1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

The unique thing I bring is my individual combination of experiences, 
skills, and perspectives. 
No one else has the exact blend of background, 
personality, and expertise which will maifest in various ways, such as my problem-solving approach, 
creativity in finding solutions, 
ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, 
or my unique insights into the work.

> 2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Taking a Break: Often the best thing to do when stuck. Step away from the problem for a while. Short walk, tea, or a different task. Giving your mind a chance to rest and reset can often lead to new perspectives and insights  after return to the problem.
2. Seek Help or Collaboration: reach out to others, online communities for assistance. Explaining the problem to someone else can help to clarify your thoughts, and they may offer suggestions or approaches you hadn't considered, fresh ideas and solutions.
3. Break It Down: Break the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. Sometimes a complex problem can seem overwhelming, but by breaking it down into smaller steps or components, you can tackle each part individually. This can identify specific areas where you're getting stuck and make progress incrementally.
