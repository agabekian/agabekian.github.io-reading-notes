## Graphs 

### Analogy

Imagine a graph as a city map. The various locations (like houses, shops, parks) are the **nodes (or vertices)**, and the roads or paths connecting these locations are the **edges**.

### In-Depth Detail: Nodes and Edges

**Why do we need nodes and edges?**
Nodes and edges form the core components of graphs, allowing us to model and analyze relationships and connections in diverse fields, from social networks to transportation systems.


**What are nodes and edges?**
- **Nodes (Vertices):** These represent entities or locations. In our analogy, these are the houses, shops, parks, etc.
- **Edges:** These represent the connections or relationships between nodes. In our analogy, these are the roads or paths between locations.


**How do nodes and edges work together in a graph?**
Nodes and edges work together to form a network or graph. For example, if you want to visit a friend's house (node) from your house (another node), you need to know the path (edge) connecting them. In computational terms, this helps in solving problems like finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, and more.

### Tutorial / Walkthrough an Example

Let's consider a simple example of a social network graph:

1. **Nodes:** Each person in the network.
2. **Edges:** Friendships between people.

Imagine a graph where:
- Alice, Bob, and Charlie are friends.
- Alice and Diana are friends.
- Bob and Eve are friends.

We can represent this as:

- **Nodes:** Alice (A), Bob (B), Charlie (C), Diana (D), Eve (E)
- **Edges:** (A-B), (A-C), (A-D), (B-E)

### Vocabulary/Definition List

- **Graph:** A collection of nodes and edges.
- **Node (Vertex):** An individual element in a graph.
- **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.
- **Undirected Graph:** A graph where edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graph:** A graph where edges have a direction.
- **Weighted Graph:** A graph where edges have weights (values).
- **Unweighted Graph:** A graph where edges do not have weights.

### Cheat Sheet

- **Graph Types:**
    - **Undirected:** No direction in edges.
    - **Directed:** Direction indicated on edges.
    - **Weighted:** Edges have weights.
    - **Unweighted:** Edges do not have weights.
- **Common Algorithms:**
    - **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    - **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Explore all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
    - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest path from a source to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

### Conversation Between Concepts

**Node A:** Hey Edge, I heard you're connecting us nodes together. What's up with that?

**Edge B:** That's right, A! Without me, you wouldn't be able to reach Node B or any other nodes. I create the paths that allow for communication and travel.

**Node C:** So, Edge, do you have a direction, or can we travel back and forth freely?

**Edge B:** It depends on the type of graph. In some, I'm directed, meaning you can only travel in one direction. In others, I'm undirected, allowing for two-way travel.

### Diagram / Visualization

Here's a simple graph representation:

```plaintext
   A --- B
   |     |
   C     E
   |
   D
```

- Nodes: A, B, C, D, E
- Edges: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-E
