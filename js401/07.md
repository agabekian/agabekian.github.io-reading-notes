1. **What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?**
    - RBAC is a security model where access rights are assigned based on roles rather than individual users. We care about RBAC because it simplifies access management, improves security, and ensures compliance by organizing permissions into roles.

2. **Describe a Role/Permission hierarchy that you might implement using RBAC.**
    - An example hierarchy might include roles like Admin, Manager, Employee, and Guest, each with different levels of access to system resources.

3. **What approach might you take to implement RBAC?**
    - Implementing RBAC involves identifying roles, assigning permissions to roles, associating users with roles, and enforcing access control mechanisms.

4. **If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?**
    - Authorization is determining what actions or resources an authenticated user is allowed to access based on their role or permissions.

5. **Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.**
    - The rules are role assignment, role authorization, and role activation.

6. **Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.**
    - RBAC is like giving different keys to different people based on their job roles. Each key unlocks certain doors, so people can only access the rooms they're supposed to be in.

7. **What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.**
    - Access rights are associated with the role. Users are assigned roles, and their access rights are determined by the permissions assigned to those roles.

8. **Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?**
    - Authorization, or access rights, is activated after a user successfully authenticates themselves.

9. **Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.**
    - RBAC benefits a business by streamlining access management, improving security, and enhancing compliance with regulatory requirements.
