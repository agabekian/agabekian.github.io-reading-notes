### React Native

### Core Components of React Native:
1. **View**: The `View`, a fundamental building block for creating UI in React Native. It acts as a container that can hold other components or views.

2. **Text**: The `Text` component is used to display text in the app. It's similar to the `<p>` or `<span>` tags in HTML. You can style text, apply different fonts, sizes, colors, and alignments using this component.

3. **Image**: The `Image` component is used to display images in the app. 

### Problem React Native Solves:
React Native allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React, while still producing real native mobile apps. This means that instead of developing separate codebases for iOS and Android, developers can write code once and deploy it across both platforms. React Native achieves this by providing a bridge that enables JavaScript code to interact with native components, ensuring a native look and feel for the app.

### Building Blocks of a React Native app vs. React app:
The building blocks of a React Native app are similar to those of a React app, as React Native is built on top of React. 
However, in React Native, these components translate to _native_ UI elements, whereas in React, they render to HTML elements.

### Expo:
A set of tools, libraries, and services built around React Native to help simplify the development process of mobile applications. It provides features like easy project setup, a wide range of pre-built components, APIs for accessing device features, and a simplified build and deployment process.

### Expo Workflow:
manages much of the complexity of building React Native apps, hence it's often referred to as the "managed" workflow.

### Difference between React Native and Expo:
React Native is the framework itself, whereas Expo is a set of tools built on top of React Native. Expo provides additional features and simplifies the development process by abstracting away some of the configuration and setup required when building React Native apps.

### Expo Snack:
Expo Snack is an online tool that allows developers to quickly prototype and test React Native code in the browser. It provides a web-based development environment where you can write React Native code, see the changes in real-time, and even share the code with others via a unique URL.

### Ejecting:
"Ejecting" in the context of Expo refers to the process of transitioning from the Expo managed workflow to the bare workflow. When you eject from Expo, you gain more control over the native code and configuration of your project but lose some of the simplicity and convenience provided by Expo's managed workflow.

### When to not eject:
You should avoid ejecting from Expo if you want to leverage the simplicity and ease of use provided by Expo's managed workflow, or if you don't have a strong need for custom native code or configurations.

### Reasons to eject:
You might choose to eject from Expo if you need to integrate third-party native libraries that are not supported by Expo, require more control over the native code and configurations of your project, or want to access advanced features not available in the managed workflow.

On Accelerometer demo I get: TypeError: this._nativeModule.addListener is not a function
at AccelerometerSensor.addListener (entry.bundle?platform=web&dev=true&hot=false&lazy=true&transform.routerRoot=app&resolver.environment=client&transform.environment=client:89180:3

You did the npm install of the library, correct?


Armen Agabekian
4:10 PM
sure, incliuding sensors
4:11
I should probably redo


John Cokos
4:14 PM
Never hurts, so long as nothing of value is there.

Dleted package-lock, modules, did npm reinstall, flashes coordinates briefly, same error
4:15
stackoverflow suggest may be new versions handle listeners differently, but that would be weird, its yheir demo


John Cokos
4:15 PM
You getting that in the browser or on the phone?


Armen Agabekian
4:16 PM
browser
4:16
lemme check hone


John Cokos

Browser doesn't have an accelerometer


Armen Agabekian
4:16 PM
Lol


John Cokos

Only the phone does, so you have to do the npm run start thing and then scan the QR code on your phone, install the app, and then run it from there only.

This is the PITA cycle of mobile development :wink:

i’m aware :slightly_smiling_face: thats why im lol

yea it works there — tunnel vision :{

Odd that errors are son generic, it should be, error: “this aint your phone, dumbass!“///
