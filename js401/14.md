## REACT 401

**Building Blocks of a React App**:

Components: The basic building blocks that represent different parts of the UI.
   
JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript.
   
State: Data (_object_) that changes over time within a component.
   
Props: Short for properties, they are inputs to a component.
   
Lifecycle Methods: Methods that are invoked at different stages of a component's lifecycle.
   
Virtual DOM: A _lightweight representation_ of the actual DOM that React updates and  uses for performance optimizations.

**Difference Between HTML Element and React Component**:
   
An HTML element represents a specific tag in the HTML document (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`).
   A React component is a reusable piece of UI that can contain multiple HTML elements and logic.

**JSX and Its Usage**:
   JSX is a syntax _extension_ for JavaScript that allows mixing HTML-like code with JavaScript.
   It's used in React to describe what the **UI** should look like.

**Embedding JavaScript Expressions in JSX**:
   JavaScript expressions can be embedded in JSX by wrapping them inside curly braces `{}`.

**Special Features for Iteration or Conditional Logic**:
   JSX supports JavaScript expressions, use standard JavaScript constructs like `map` for iteration and `if` statements for conditional logic.

**How React Responds to User Inputs**:
   React responds to user inputs by **updating component state** or **invoking callback functions passed as props**.

**Word Indicating Data Management with a Hook**:
   typically "useState".

**Sharing Data Between React Components**:
   can be achieved by _**lifting state**_ up to a common ancestor, using context, or passing data through props.

**Three Steps of Refreshing a React UI**:
   
Render: The process of generating a React element tree based on the current state and props.
   
Commit: The process of updating the DOM to reflect the changes made during the render phase.
   
Reconciliation: The process of comparing the new element tree with the previous one to determine the minimal set of changes needed to update the DOM.

**Triggering Updates to a Component After Initial Render**:

Updates to a component can be triggered by changing its state using `setState`, or by passing new props to the component.

**! on Every Rerender**:

React doesn't recreate DOM nodes on every rerender, it **updates** only the parts of the DOM that have changed.

**What Needs to Happen Before the User Sees the Change After DOM Update**:

Before the user sees the change, the browser needs to paint the updated DOM onto the screen. This involves the browser's rendering pipeline, which includes steps like layout, paint, and composition.
