 ## useEffect 
allows to perform actions that fall outside the core lifecycle methods of a functional component. These side effects can include:
* Fetching data from APIs
* Setting up subscriptions (like timers or event listeners)
* Manually manipulating the DOM (use with caution)
* Performing actions after the component updates (e.g., updating third-party libraries)

### Interaction with the Component:

- Effect Logic: You provide a function within useEffect that encapsulates the side effect logic. This function can access component props and state, but it shouldn't directly update the state itself (use the useState hook for that).

 
- Dependency Array (Optional): You can optionally provide a second argument to useEffect - an array of dependencies. This array determines when the effect function **re-runs**. The effect will re-run whenever a dependency in the array changes. If no dependency array is provided, the effect runs after every render.

 
- Cleanup Function (Optional): The effect function can optionally return a cleanup function. This function is executed before the component unmounts or before the effect runs again if the dependencies change. It's used for any necessary cleanup tasks associated with the side effect, like clearing timers or removing event listeners.

### Importance of the Return Value:

The return value from the effect function (if any) is specifically used for cleanup purposes. It's not directly used to update the component state or UI. It should be a function that performs any necessary cleanup actions when the component unmounts or the effect re-runs due to dependency changes.
In summary:

useEffect bridges the gap between functional components and side effects, allowing you to manage state changes triggered by external factors or actions outside the component itself.
It provides a way to interact with data, subscriptions, and external libraries while keeping the component logic clean and focused on UI rendering based on state.
