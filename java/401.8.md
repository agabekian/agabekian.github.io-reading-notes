 #### DRY and Rule of three.
Don't Repeat Yourself.
Rule of three ("Three strikes and you refactor") is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure. The rule was popularised by Martin Fowler in Refactoring[1] and attributed to Don Roberts.
#### YAGNI

"You aren't gonna need it"[1][2] (YAGNI)[3] is a principle which arose from extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.[4] Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it" (YAGTNI) [5][6] and "You ain't gonna need it" (YAGNI).[7]

XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."[8] John Carmack has written "It is hard for less experienced developers to appreciate how rarely architecting for future requirements / applications turns out net-positive."[9]

### MVP
A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.[1][2]

A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (possibly) unnecessary work. Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements
