#### What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.

An Intent object carries information that the Android system uses to determine which component to start (such as the exact component name or component category that should receive the intent), plus information that the recipient component uses in order to properly perform the action (such as the action to take and the data to act upon).

Say, you want to use a camera, you can use intent to start appropriate components/services
