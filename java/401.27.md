# Hashtable

Hastable is data structure allowing us to store data as key/value pairs and providing the faster access than array with O(1). Parameterized types. We use combination of arrays with its elements referred as  "buckets"(nodes) that in turn contain single-linked-lists.

_A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value._

Linked lists handle the collision when the same "bucket" is addressed by multiple keys. 

_itâ€™s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input. Hash codes MUST(--JB) never have randomness to them. The same key should always produce the same hash code_
