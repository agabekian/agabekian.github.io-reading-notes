What Is an Object?
An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. This lesson explains how state and behavior are represented within an object, introduces the concept of data encapsulation, and explains the benefits of designing your software in this manner.

What Is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses on the basics, showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.

What Is Inheritance?
Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software. 

What Is an Interface?
An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.

What Is a Package?
A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage.

##Java Classes


In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:

1. Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later. (However, note that the private modifier can only be applied to Nested Classes.)
2. The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
3 The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
4. A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
5. The class body, surrounded by braces,{}

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

### Binary 

 are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.

### Decimal

Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which:

### Hex-adecimal (16)

They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
