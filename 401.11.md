Spring application that has a static home page and that will also 
customize the greeting with an optional name parameter in the query string. The URL might then be http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User.


    @Controller
    public class GreetingController {

	@GetMapping("/greeting")
	public String greeting(@RequestParam(name="name", required=false, defaultValue="World") String name, Model model) {
		model.addAttribute("name", name);
		return "greeting";
	}
}

The @GetMapping annotation ensures that HTTP GET requests to ```/greeting ```are mapped to the ```greeting()``` method.

```@RequestParam``` binds the value of the query string parameter``` name ```into the name parameter of the ```greeting()``` method. This query string parameter is not ```required```. If it is absent in the request, the ```defaultValue``` of ```World``` is used. The value of the ```name``` parameter is added to a ```Model``` object, ultimately making it accessible to the view template.

The implementation of the method body relies on a view technology (in this case, Thymeleaf) to perform server-side rendering of the HTML. Thymeleaf parses the ```greeting.html``` template and evaluates the ```th:text``` expression to render the value of the ```${name}``` parameter that was set in the controller.The following listing (from ```src/main/resources/templates/greeting.html```) shows the greeting.html template:

In a typical Spring MVC application, @Controller classes are responsible for preparing a model map with data and selecting a view to be rendered. This model map allows for the complete abstraction of the view technology and, in the case of Thymeleaf, it is transformed into a Thymeleaf context object (part of the Thymeleaf template execution context) that makes all the defined variables available to expressions executed in templates.

1. Spring model attributes
Spring MVC calls the pieces of data that can be accessed during the execution of views model attributes. The equivalent term in Thymeleaf language is context variables.

2. Request parameters
Request parameters can be easily accessed in Thymeleaf views. Request parameters are passed from the client to server like:
    ```https://example.com/query?q=Thymeleaf+Is+Great!```

3. Session attributes
4. ServletContext attributes
