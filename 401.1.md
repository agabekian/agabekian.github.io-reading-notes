# Data Structures and Algorithms

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?



> To pick the best data structure to solve a particular problem, we have to take into account what are the operations we are going to perform and how often they are going to be executed. Then, we need to choose the data structure that delivers the best performance trade-off over the tasks we have to accomplish.
