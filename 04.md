## Forms

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

An input form element whose value is controlled by solely React (“single source of truth”)

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

We update the state right away, this way controlled components work as expected. Values can be passe to other UI elements and can be reset

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

with event.target.value etc

The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

### Why would we use a ternary operator?

It's shorter, useful for inline code in react JSX.

### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

    if(x===y){
    console.log(true);
    } else {
    console.log(false);
    }

    console.log(x == y ? true : false)
